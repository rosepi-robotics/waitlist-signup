  <h1>Rallie Tennis - May Progress Update</h1>
  
  <p>Hello from Rallie Tennis!</p>
  
  <p>We've just published our May update on the progress page. Here are the highlights:</p>
  
  <h2>May Draw Winner Announcement</h2>
  <p>Congratulations to <strong>Delice</strong> for winning our May $100 Tennis Warehouse gift card draw!</p>
  <p>Thank you to everyone who participated in our survey and referred friends! Your feedback is invaluable as we continue to develop our tennis ball machine.</p>
  
  <h2>Development Progress</h2>
  
  <h3>Hardware</h3>
  <p>We're making exciting progress on the hardware front!</p>
  <p>We've successfully assembled our first prototype using RoboMaster motors and 3D printed parts to test our "dual flywheel launching" concept. The results are promising - we achieved launch speeds of ~75mph, confirming that our design direction is on the right track.</p>
  <p>Based on these learnings, we're now advancing to the next development phase with custom motors and a new flywheel design that promises to further reduce the overall volume and weight of the machine.</p>
  
  <h3>Software</h3>
  <p>On the software front, we've developed a functional app that can detect player position and poses in real-time, and through our custom reasoning module, determine the optimal ball placement for your practice session.</p>
  <p>We've also started experimenting with training custom models to better adapt to various lighting conditions and camera positions.</p>
  
  <h3>Other Updates</h3>
  <p>We expect to have several EVT (Engineering Verification Test) units ready by late July or early August. Once these are shipped to the States, we plan to host several user testing events in the Bay Area this summer.</p>
  
  <h2>My Thoughts on Acemate and Tenniix</h2>
  <p>I've shared my analysis of the recent Kickstarter campaigns for tennis ball machines, including thoughts on their design choices, potential durability issues, and realistic expectations for the technology.</p>
